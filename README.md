## Inspiration
We were inspired mainly by When2meet. Seeing how technology could be used to piece together schedules, and more importantly clearly display important information gave us the idea to attempt to improve how we organize and group people together. From walking into a new classroom to forming project groups, shared interests and values are important pieces of data that can help us make better predictions as to compatible members and ideas.

## What it does
Meet Together leverages data from Google Forms and customizable surveys to streamline the process of organizing events and groups. By utilizing this data, it saves valuable time for organizers and users while boosting productivity.

## How we built it
We built Meet Together using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allowed us to create an interactive and responsive web application. We also integrated Google Forms data, enabling seamless data collection and management. The customization and flexibility of React played a pivotal role in developing a user-friendly experience.

## Challenges we ran into
During the development of Meet Together, we encountered several challenges. These included handling and processing data from Google Forms, creating a smooth user experience, and implementing complex algorithms to predict compatibility. Additionally, creating a highly customizable survey system presented its own set of challenges. Addressing these issues required careful planning and collaborative problem-solving.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take pride in the successful implementation of customizable surveys and predictive algorithms that help users form groups and make connections based on shared interests and values. Additionally, we're proud of the user-friendly interface we've created, which simplifies the process of organizing events and groups.

## What we learned
Throughout the development of Meet Together, we gained valuable insights into various aspects of software development, including:

Data Integration: We deepened our understanding of integrating external data sources and utilizing APIs effectively. This was crucial in our ability to seamlessly incorporate Google Forms data into our application.

Algorithm Development: We honed our skills in creating algorithms for matching individuals based on specific criteria. This experience allowed us to create more efficient and accurate matching systems.

User Experience: We learned the importance of designing a user-centric interface for optimal user engagement. We now recognize that a well-designed user interface is essential for user satisfaction and the success of the platform.

## What's next for Meet Together
The future for Meet Together is promising, and we have several exciting plans in store:

We want to fully implement our algorithm to make the process of selecting groups a flawless experience for both the organizers and the users.

Our goal is to begin using NLP models to allow for organizers to utilize text boxes within their forms. With this, we could match common keywords found in user responses, deepening the complexity of our matching algorithm.

We are excited to see what the future holds, and thoroughly enjoyed our time developing for the DubHacks '23 Hackathon.
